# FinitePi

Uses the popular Machin-Like algorithm to great amounts of precision in calculating &pi;.
The Machin-Like formula proposed by Hwang Chien-Lih from 1997 is currently being used.

By implementing a GUI, calculations can be made to relatively large decimal precision values and progress can be monitored during these calculations.
